In Python, members defined with double underscores (__) as prefix and suffixes are called "dunder" (double underscore) methods or "magic" methods. These methods have special meanings in Python and are used for various purposes such as operator overloading, customization of behavior for built-in functions, and implementation of specific language features.

use cases
1	Operator Overloading: Dunder methods allow classes to define custom behavior for built-in operators. For example, the __add__ method allows objects of a class to support the + operator.

	example:
		class MyClass:
			def __init__(self, value):
				self.value = value
			
			def __add__(self, other):
				return MyClass(self.value + other.value)

		obj1 = MyClass(5)
		obj2 = MyClass(10)
		result = obj1 + obj2  # Calls obj1.__add__(obj2)


2 String Representation: The __str__ and __repr__ methods control how instances of a class are represented as strings. This affects the behavior of functions like str() and repr().
	



3 Lifecycle Management: Dunder methods like __init__ (constructor) and __del__ (destructor) are used for object initialization and cleanup, respectively.
