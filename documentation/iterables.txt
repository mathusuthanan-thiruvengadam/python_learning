Iterables are objects that can be iterated in iterations i.e which can be looped over or iterated over with the help of a for loop.
	- Objects like lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, strings, etc. are called iterables. In short and simpler terms, iterable is anything that you can loop over.
	- In simpler words, iterable is a container that has data or values and we perform an iteration over it to get elements one by one. (Can traverse through all the given values one by one)
	- Iterable has an in-built dunder method __iter__.
