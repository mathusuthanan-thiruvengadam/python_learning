list of things that can not be done with python that is possible with C
========================================================================
  -	Python/C API
	  -	This is the most direct way to integrate C code with Python. 
	  -	It allows you to write C extension modules that can be imported and used like regular Python modules. 
	  -	You can call C functions from Python and pass data between Python and C. 
	  -	However, this method requires a good understanding of both C and Python.
  -	Cython
	  -	Python that compiles to C
	  - write code that is almost pure Python, with only a few annotations to declare types
	  -	code is then compiled to C and can be imported into Python like a regular module.
  -	ctypes
	  -	foreign function interface module in Python that allows you to call functions and use data types from shared libraries written in C
